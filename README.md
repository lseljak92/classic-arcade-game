## How to Play

The goal of this game is to reach the water avoiding the collision with the bugs (enemies). The player is able to move left, right, up and down. The enemies move at random speeds on the paved block section of the screen.
If the player collides with a bug, the game is reset and the player is relocated to its starting position.
